# Designing a SaaS Platform for Multi-tenant Gaming Sites

## 1. Designing the System for Custom Domains

To support multiple gaming sites each serving games from their own domain, the system should be designed with the following considerations:

- **Multi-tenancy Architecture:** Implement a multi-tenancy architecture where each gaming site operates independently within the same platform instance.

- **Dynamic Domain Handling:** Configure the platform to dynamically handle requests based on the domain or subdomain from which the request originates. This ensures that each gaming site can be accessed via its dedicated domain (e.g., cool-games.com, luck-games.co.uk).

- **Isolation of Data and Resources:** Ensure that each gaming site's data (games, player information, etc.) is logically and securely isolated from other gaming sites. This prevents data leakage and unauthorized access between tenants.

## 2. Modifying the Users Table

To support multi-tenancy in the users table, modifications should be made as follows:

- **Addition of a Tenant Identifier:** Introduce a field in the users table that uniquely identifies the tenant (gaming site) to which each user belongs. This could be a domain name, a subdomain, or a specific identifier linked to the tenant.

- **Scoped Queries:** Ensure that all queries related to user operations (authentication, profile management, etc.) are scoped by the tenant identifier. This prevents cross-tenant data access and ensures that operations are restricted to the appropriate tenant's context.

- **Enhanced Indexing:** Consider indexing the tenant identifier field to optimize query performance, especially in environments with large datasets or high query volumes.

## 3. Secure User Authentication Across Domains

To validate user login securely across different gaming domains, follow these practices:

- **Token-Based Authentication:** Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) where tokens are signed with a tenant-specific secret key. This ensures that tokens issued for one gaming site cannot be used to authenticate requests meant for another gaming site.

- **Tenant-Specific Secrets:** Use different secrets or keys to sign tokens for each gaming site. These secrets should be securely managed and rotated periodically to maintain security.

- **Request Validation:** Validate incoming requests against the domain or tenant identifier associated with the request. Ensure that the request matches the expected domain context before proceeding with any sensitive operations.

- **Session Management:** Manage user sessions scoped by domain or tenant. Ensure that sessions are maintained and invalidated correctly based on the tenant context to prevent unauthorized access.

By implementing these strategies, the SaaS platform can effectively support multiple gaming sites as tenants, each operating independently with their own domain and maintaining secure data segregation.
